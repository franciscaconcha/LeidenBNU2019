	Notes on using pc's/AMUSE
- use the /data1 disks of your pc
  - /home is a network disk, with less and slower storage (max 4 GB)
  - /data1 is the hard drive of your pc. So keep using the same pc!
  - create a folder with your name
- AMUSE is a python module, but is a bit more involved to run
  - instead of using 'python script.py', run with 'mpiexec amuse script.py'
